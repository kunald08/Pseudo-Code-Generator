# Pseudo-Code-Generator

A Pseudo-Code generator for simple C++ programs.

## How It Works
1. The project consists of two files: `main.cpp` and `prog.cpp`.
2. `prog.cpp` contains the program that will be converted into pseudo-code.
3. `main.cpp` is compiled and executed to generate the pseudo-code output for `prog.cpp`.
4. An `output.txt` file is created containing the pseudo-code.
5. `audio.py` is then executed, which reads `output.txt` and generates an audio file.

### Output
- The generated audio file is named **`source_code_voice_over.mp3`**.

### Contribution
Currently, the pseudo-code generation has limited functionalities. Contributions are welcome to enhance and improve this repository! ðŸ˜Š

### Use Case
This tool is particularly helpful for visually impaired individuals who are learning to program. However, it is not yet production-ready.

Feel free to contribute and improve this project! ðŸš€
